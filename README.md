`HMMERTIME` is an R package that can be used to infer between sample identity by descent (IBD) among genotypes that are unphased and potentially "multiclonal", or polyclonal. Check out the package vignettes for more information and use cases!   


## IMPORTANT NOTES

:warning: This model is in active development and so parameter name and
behaviours, and output file formats will change without notice.  
  
Previously, this model was presented as `polyIBD` (presented at [GEM-2016](https://www.malariagen.net/news-events/events/gem-2016)). We have "re-branded" this _version-1_ software as `HMMERTIME` and will reserve the name `polyIBD` for future investigations of the problem of polyclonality and identity by descent that do not rely on hidden Markov models.   


## Installation & Use
Please see the vignettes for installation and use instructions. Thank you for your interest in our package.
