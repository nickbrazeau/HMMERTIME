# Overview 
`HMMERTIME` is an R package that can be used to infer regions of identity by descent (IBD) from samples that are unphased and potentially polyclonal.   


## Scope of the Problem
Recently, several programs have been written to address this problem, including Henden's [`isorelate`](https://github.com/bahlolab/isoRelate) and Schaffner/Taylors's [`hmmIBD`](https://github.com/glipsnort/hmmIBD). Here we build upon the `hmmIBD` framework and extend it for the setting of multiplicities of infections greater than 1. The  **assume that the multiplicity of infection (MOI) is unknown and is not limited to 2.**
